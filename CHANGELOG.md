## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.166] - 2025-10-22

### Added

- **MD013: `paragraphs` field to control paragraph line length checks** (resolves #121)
  - New boolean config field `paragraphs` (defaults to `true`) allows disabling line length warnings for paragraph text
  - Enables sentence-per-line formatting workflows without line length validation noise
  - Still checks headings, tables, code blocks, blockquotes, and HTML when `paragraphs: false`
  - Useful for semantic line breaks where sentence length is determined by content, not arbitrary limits
  - Example configuration:
    ```yaml
    MD013:
      paragraphs: false  # Don't warn about long paragraphs
      code-blocks: true  # Still check code blocks
      tables: true       # Still check tables
      reflow: true
      reflow-mode: "sentence-per-line"
    ```

## [0.0.165] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed

- **MD040: Always preserve indentation when adding language tags** (fixes #122)
  - The MD040 rule was incorrectly removing indentation from code blocks when adding language tags
  - This broke list structure when code blocks were part of list items
  - Root cause: The fix logic had conditional behavior that would remove indentation for "standalone" code blocks
  - Now always preserves original indentation regardless of context
  - Removed 50+ lines of unnecessary `is_in_nested_context()` helper logic
  - Added comprehensive tests for various indentation scenarios (0, 2, 4, 6 spaces)

### Added

- **Conventional Commits validation hook**: Git commit-msg hook validates commit message format
  - Enforces Conventional Commits specification for all commits
  - Provides helpful error messages for invalid formats
  - Ensures consistent commit history for changelog generation

- **Automated changelog generation with git-cliff**:
  - Added `make changelog-draft` for previewing CHANGELOG updates
  - Semi-automated workflow: generate draft, enhance with details, commit
  - Conventional Commits integration for automatic categorization

### Changed

- **Pre-push hook optimization**: Use dev profile instead of full suite for faster testing
  - Prevents pre-push hook from hanging on slower machines
  - Maintains adequate test coverage while improving developer experience

## [0.0.164] - 2025-10-21

### Added

- **File-Level Caching (Ruff-inspired)**: Dramatic performance improvements for repeat runs
  - Blake3-based content hashing for fast cache lookups
  - Automatic cache invalidation on content, config, or version changes
  - Cache stored in `.rumdl-cache/{version}/{hash}.json`
  - CLI flags: `--no-cache` to disable, `--cache-dir` to customize location
  - Enabled by default for instant subsequent runs

- **Thread-Safe Parallel Caching**: Best of both worlds - parallelization AND caching
  - Implemented Arc<Mutex<LintCache>> for safe cache sharing across threads
  - Mutex locked ONLY for brief cache get/set operations
  - Full parallelization during expensive linting operations
  - Matches Ruff's architecture for optimal performance

- **Convergence Detection**: Added hash-based detection to identify when fixes have stabilized
  - Stops iteration when content hash remains unchanged
  - More efficient than counting rule applications
  - Returns convergence status in fix results

- **Convergence Failure Warnings**: Report when auto-fix doesn't converge (Ruff-style)
  - Warns if 100 iteration limit reached without convergence
  - Shows rule codes involved in potential infinite loop
  - Encourages bug reports for convergence failures
  - Available via `RUMDL_DEBUG_FIX_PERF` environment variable

### Changed

- **Auto-fix Iteration**: Automatic iteration until convergence (fixes #88)
  - `--fix` now automatically iterates up to 100 passes until content stabilizes (same as Ruff)
  - No need to manually re-run `rumdl check --fix` multiple times
  - Hash-based convergence detection prevents unnecessary iterations
  - Significantly improves user experience for multi-pass fix scenarios

- **Unified Linting Architecture**: Removed ~60 lines of duplicate linting logic
  - Refactored `process_file_collect_warnings` to use `process_file_inner`
  - Single code path for all file processing
  - Cache works for ALL output formats (text, JSON, GitLab, SARIF, JUnit)

- **Parallel File Processing for Fix Mode**: 4.8x speedup on multi-file fixes
  - Previously fix mode was always sequential
  - Now uses parallel processing when safe (multiple independent files)
  - Each file processes all its fix iterations independently

### Fixed

- **Multi-pass Fixes**: No longer require manual re-runs to apply all possible fixes
  - Previously users had to run `rumdl check --fix` multiple times
  - Now automatically handles dependent rule fixes in single command
  - Examples: MD010 (tabs) before MD007 (list indent), MD013 (line length) before MD009 (trailing spaces)

- **Cache Correctness**: Include enabled rules in cache key (Ruff-style)
  - Cache now respects `--enable`/`--disable` CLI flags
  - Different rule configurations create separate cache entries
  - Prevents incorrect cached results when switching rule sets
  - Changed `LintWarning.rule_name` from `Option<&'static str>` to `Option<String>` for proper serialization

- **Cache Parallelization**: Cache now works correctly with parallel processing
  - No mutex contention during parallel file processing
  - All output formats benefit from caching (previously only JSON/GitLab/SARIF/JUnit)

### Performance

- **Single file with cache**: 943ms → 7ms (135x faster)
- **Multi-file (21 files) cold cache**: 14.4s → 4s (parallel processing)
- **Multi-file (21 files) warm cache**: 14.4s → 0.019s (757x faster!)
- **JSON format (17 files) with cache**: 13.9s → 60ms (231x faster)

### Fixed

- **MD013**: Enforce line length in sentence_per_line mode (fixes #111)

  - Now warns about single sentences exceeding configured line_length
  - No auto-fix for long single sentences (requires manual rephrasing)
  - Still auto-fixes multi-sentence lines by splitting on sentence boundaries
  - Cleaned up warning messages by removing verbose parentheticals
  - Maintains semantic integrity (won't split mid-sentence) while respecting configured line_length

- **HTML Comments**: Complete fix to ignore all content inside HTML comments (fixes #119, #20)
  - All rules now properly ignore content within HTML comment blocks (`<!-- ... -->`)
