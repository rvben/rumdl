fn test_issue_42_lists_separated_by_heading() {
    // Test case from issue #42 - two lists separated by a heading should be treated as separate lists
    let content = r#"# The 4 ways to import a module

There are four different ways to import:

1. Import the whole module using its original name:

    ```python
    import random
    ```

2. Import specific things from the module:

    ```python
    from random import choice, randint
    ```

3. Import the whole module and rename it, usually using a shorter variable name:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    ```

4. Import specific things from the module and rename them as you're importing them:

    ```python
    from os.path import join as join_path
    ```

That last one is usually done to avoid a name collision or *sometimes* to make a more descriptive name (though that's not very common).

## My recommendations

1. Use `from` for **short and descriptive variable names**
    I tend to use the `from` syntax most (number 2 above) because I prefer **short and descriptive variable names**.

2. Import the whole module if needed **to avoid ambiguity**.
    If there's a name like `choice` that isn't as clear as `random.choice`, then I prefer to import the whole module for a more descriptive name

3. **Avoid renaming imports**.
    I very rarely use the `as` syntax (unless I'm in the `pandas` or `numpy` worlds, where it's common convention).
    And I almost never use the `as` syntax with `from` unless I'm avoiding a name collision.
