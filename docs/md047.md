# MD047 - Files Should End With a Single Newline Character

## Description

This rule ensures that all files end with a single newline character. This is a common convention in
text files and helps with file concatenation, viewing in terminals, and version control diffs.

Many editors automatically add a newline at the end of a file, but some don't, which can lead to
inconsistent file endings.

<!-- rumdl-disable MD047 MD031 MD040 -->

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
# Document Title

This is a paragraph.

```

Note: The file ends with a single newline character after the closing backticks.

### Invalid

```markdown
# Document Title

This is a paragraph.```

Note: The file ends immediately after the closing backticks without a newline.

### Fixed

```markdown
# Document Title

This is a paragraph.

```

Note: A single newline character has been added at the end of the file.
<!-- rumdl-enable MD047 MD031 MD040 -->

## Special Cases

- This rule only checks for the presence of a single newline character at the end of the file
- It does not check for multiple newline characters (use MD012 for that)
- The rule applies to all Markdown files, regardless of content
- Empty files are considered valid
