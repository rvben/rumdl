# MD047 - End Files with a Single Newline

## What this rule does

Ensures every file ends with exactly one newline character, following standard text file conventions.

## Why this matters

- **Version control**: Git and other tools expect files to end with newlines
- **File concatenation**: Prevents issues when combining files
- **Terminal display**: Files display correctly in command-line tools
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Consistent behavior across operating systems

## Examples

### ‚úÖ Correct

```markdown
# My Document

This is the content of my document.

The last line ends with a single newline.
```

(Note: There's an invisible newline after "newline.")

### ‚ùå Incorrect  

```markdown
# My Document

This is the content of my document.

The last line has no newline.```
(Note: The file ends immediately after the last character)

```markdown
# My Document  

This is the content of my document.

The last line has multiple newlines.


```

(Note: Multiple blank lines at the end)

### üîß Fixed

```markdown
# My Document

This is the content of my document.

The last line now ends with a single newline.
```

(Note: Exactly one newline added at the end)

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options.

## Automatic fixes

When enabled, this rule will:
- Add a newline if the file doesn't end with one
- Remove extra newlines if there are multiple
- Ensure exactly one newline at the end

## Why this matters technically

- Many text editors automatically add this newline
- POSIX defines a line as ending with a newline
- Prevents "No newline at end of file" warnings
- Makes file processing more predictable

## Special cases

- Empty files are considered valid
- Binary files are not checked
- The rule only checks for a single newline, not multiple blank lines (see MD012)
