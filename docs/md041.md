# MD041 - Start Your Document with a Clear Title

## What this rule does

Ensures every document begins with a top-level heading (like `# Title`), giving your document a clear title and purpose from the start.

## Why this matters

- **Professional appearance**: Documents without titles look incomplete and unprofessional
- **Better navigation**: Readers and tools can quickly identify what the document is about
- **Improved SEO**: Search engines and documentation systems rely on document titles
- **Consistent structure**: All documents in your project will have a uniform starting point

## Configuration

```yaml
MD041:
  level: 1                    # Heading level required (1-6, default: 1)
  front_matter_title: "title" # Front matter field to use as title
```

## Automatic fixes

When enabled, this rule will:
- Add a generic `# Title` heading at the beginning of documents that lack one
- You should replace this with a meaningful title for your document

## Special cases

- Documents with front matter containing a title field are considered valid
- Empty documents are not checked
- HTML comments at the start are ignored when checking
