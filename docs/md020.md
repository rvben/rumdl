# MD020 - No Missing Space in Closed ATX Heading

## Description

This rule ensures that there is a space between the hash signs (#) and the heading text in closed ATX-style headings.
A missing space can cause inconsistent rendering across different Markdown processors.

```

### Fixed

```

## Special Cases

- This rule only applies to closed ATX-style headings (those with hash signs at both the beginning and end)
- It does not apply to regular ATX headings (those with hash signs only at the beginning)
- It does not apply to setext-style headings (those underlined with = or -)
- Empty headings (just hash signs with no text) are not affected
