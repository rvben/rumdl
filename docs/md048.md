# MD048 - Code Fence Style

## Description

This rule ensures that code fence markers use a consistent style throughout a document. Markdown supports  
two styles of code fence markers: backticks (```) and tildes (~~~).

By default, this rule enforces the use of backticks for code fence markers.

<!-- rumdl-disable MD048 -->
## Examples

### Valid

Consistent use of backticks (when style is set to "backtick"):

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

### Invalid

Mixed code fence styles:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

~~~python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
~~~

### Fixed

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
<!-- rumdl-enable MD048 -->

## Configuration

This rule has the following configuration options:

- `style`: The style of code fence markers to enforce. Can be one of:
  - `"consistent"`: Enforce the first code fence style used in the document (default)
  - `"backtick"`: Enforce the use of backticks (```)
  - `"tilde"`: Enforce the use of tildes (~~~)

## Special Cases

- This rule only applies to fenced code blocks
- It does not apply to indented code blocks
- When style is set to "consistent", the first code fence style used in the document is enforced
- The rule checks both the opening and closing fence markers
- The rule preserves the language specifier when fixing code fence styles
