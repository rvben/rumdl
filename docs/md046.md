# MD046 - Use Consistent Code Block Style

## What this rule does

Ensures all code blocks in your document use the same style - either fenced (with backticks) or indented (with spaces).

## Why this matters

- **Readability**: Mixing styles makes documents harder to scan and understand
- **Maintainability**: Consistent style makes code blocks easier to edit
- **Tool compatibility**: Some tools work better with one style over another
- **Professional appearance**: Consistency shows attention to detail

## Examples

### ‚úÖ Correct (Fenced style)

````markdown
Here's how to use our API:

```javascript
const api = require('our-api');
api.connect();
```

And here's the response format:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {}
}
```
````

### ‚ùå Incorrect (Mixed styles)

````markdown
Here's how to use our API:

```javascript
const api = require('our-api');
api.connect();
```

And here's the response format:

    {
      "status": "success",
      "data": {}
    }
````

### üîß Fixed

````markdown
Here's how to use our API:

```javascript

api.connect();
```

And here's the response format:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {}
}
```
````

## Configuration

```yaml
MD046:
  style: "consistent"    # Options: "consistent", "fenced", "indented"
                        # Default: "consistent" (use first style found)
```

## Automatic fixes

When enabled, this rule will:
- Convert all code blocks to match your configured style
- Preserve code content and language identifiers
- Maintain proper spacing around blocks

## Style comparison

**Fenced code blocks** (recommended):
- Support syntax highlighting with language identifiers
- Easier to copy and paste
- More visible boundaries

**Indented code blocks**:
- Traditional Markdown style
- No language identifier support
- Must indent each line with 4 spaces or 1 tab

## Special cases

- Empty code blocks are ignored
- HTML `<pre>` and `<code>` tags are not affected
- When using "consistent", the first code block sets the style
