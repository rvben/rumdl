fenced code blocks improves readability and ensures proper rendering across different Markdown processors.

## Configuration

This rule has the following configuration options:

- `list_items`: Whether to require blank lines around fenced code blocks in list items. Default is `true`.

## Special Cases

- This rule applies to both fenced code blocks (using backticks or tildes)
- It checks for blank lines both before and after code blocks
- When `list_items` is set to `false`, code blocks in list items are exempt from this rule
