# MD031 - Code blocks need blank lines around them

## What this rule does

Ensures code blocks (```) have blank lines before and after them for proper spacing.

## Why this matters

- **Readability**: Blank lines visually separate code from surrounding text
- **Rendering**: Some Markdown processors require blank lines for proper code block display
- **Consistency**: Uniform spacing makes documents look professional

## Examples

### ‚úÖ Correct

````markdown
Here's some text explaining the code.

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

And here's more text after the code.
````

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```
And here's more text after the code.

### üîß Fixed

## Configuration

```yaml
MD031:
  list_items: true  # Also require blank lines in lists (default: true)
```

### Example with list_items

When `list_items` is true (default):

```markdown
1. First item

   ```python
   code_in_list()
   ```

2. Second item
```

When `list_items` is false:

```markdown
1. First item
   ```python
   code_in_list()
   ```
2. Second item
```

- After code blocks that don't have one
