# MD013 - Keep lines short for better readability

## What this rule does

Checks that lines don't exceed a maximum length to ensure your content is easy to read on all devices.

## Why this matters

- **Improves readability**: Shorter lines are easier to scan and understand quickly
- **Works everywhere**: Content displays properly on mobile devices, terminals, and narrow windows
- **Better for code reviews**: Side-by-side comparisons work better with reasonable line lengths
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers and assistive technologies handle shorter lines more effectively

## Examples

<!-- rumdl-disable MD013 -->

### ‚úÖ Correct

```markdown
This line is a reasonable length that's easy to read
and displays well on all devices.

Even with links, you can keep lines manageable by using
[reference-style links][1] instead of inline URLs.

```

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```markdown
This is an extremely long line that goes on and on and makes it difficult to read the content, especially on mobile devices or when viewing files in split-screen editors or during code reviews where horizontal space is limited.
```

### üîß Fixed

```markdown
This is a line that has been wrapped to stay within
the maximum length, making it much easier to read
and work with in various contexts.
```

<!-- rumdl-enable MD013 -->

## Configuration

```yaml
MD013:
  line_length: 100        # Maximum characters per line (default: 80)
  code_blocks: false      # Don't check code blocks (default: true)
  tables: false           # Don't check tables (default: true)
  headings: true          # Check headings (default: true)
```

## Automatic fixes

This rule doesn't automatically fix long lines because breaking them requires understanding the content's meaning. You'll need to manually wrap lines at appropriate points.
