# MD024 - Avoid duplicate heading text

## What this rule does

Checks that headings don't have identical text, preventing confusion and navigation issues.

## Why this matters

- **Better navigation**: Unique headings make it easier to find specific sections
- **Clear table of contents**: Automated TOCs need unique headings to create proper links
- **Improved accessibility**: Screen readers rely on unique headings for navigation
- **Avoid confusion**: Readers won't wonder which "Introduction" section they're in

## Automatic fixes

This rule cannot be automatically fixed because changing heading text requires understanding the content's meaning. You'll need to manually update duplicate headings to be more descriptive.
