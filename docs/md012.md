# MD012 - Remove multiple blank lines

Aliases: `no-multiple-blanks`

## What this rule does

Reduces multiple consecutive blank lines to just one, keeping your documents clean and consistent.

## Why this matters

- **Readability**: Too many blank lines make documents feel disconnected and harder to follow
- **File size**: Extra blank lines waste space without adding value
- **Professional appearance**: Clean spacing looks polished and intentional
- **Consistency**: Standard spacing makes documents easier to maintain

## Examples

### ✅ Correct

```markdown
# Chapter 1

This is the introduction paragraph.

## Section 1.1

Content for this section.

## Section 1.2

More content here.
```

### ❌ Incorrect

<!-- rumdl-disable MD012 -->

```markdown
# Chapter 1


This is the introduction paragraph.



## Section 1.1

Content for this section.


## Section 1.2


More content here.
```

<!-- rumdl-enable MD012 -->

### 🔧 Fixed

```markdown
# Chapter 1

This is the introduction paragraph.

## Section 1.1

Content for this section.

## Section 1.2

More content here.
```

## Configuration

```toml
[MD012]
maximum = 1  # Maximum number of consecutive blank lines allowed (default: 1)
```

## Heading awareness

Blank lines immediately before or after headings (ATX and Setext) are **not flagged** by this rule. Heading spacing is the domain of [MD022](md022.md) (`blanks-around-headings`), which has its own `lines-above` and `lines-below` configuration.

This prevents conflicts when MD022 requires more than one blank line around headings. For example, with `lines-above = 2`, you need two blank lines before each heading — MD012 will not interfere with that.

```toml
[MD022]
lines-above = 2
lines-below = 1
```

```markdown
# Title


## Section
```

The two blank lines before `## Section` are allowed by MD012 because they are adjacent to a heading. Multiple blank lines between non-heading content are still flagged normally.

## Automatic fixes

This rule automatically removes excess blank lines, keeping at most the configured maximum (default: 1) between non-heading content blocks. Blank lines adjacent to headings are preserved as-is.
