# MD012 - Remove multiple blank lines

## What this rule does

Reduces multiple consecutive blank lines to just one, keeping your documents clean and consistent.

## Why this matters

- **Readability**: Too many blank lines make documents feel disconnected and harder to follow
- **File size**: Extra blank lines waste space without adding value
- **Professional appearance**: Clean spacing looks polished and intentional
- **Consistency**: Standard spacing makes documents easier to maintain
