# MD014 - Show command output in documentation

## What this rule does

Checks that shell commands in code blocks include their output, making documentation more helpful and complete.

## Why this matters

- **Better documentation**: Readers can see what to expect when they run commands
- **Reduces confusion**: No guessing about whether a command worked or what it produced
- **Improves learning**: Examples with output help users understand command behavior
- **Catches errors**: Missing output often indicates incomplete or untested documentation

## Examples

## Configuration

```yaml

  # This rule is not configurable
```

## Automatic fixes

This rule cannot be automatically fixed because the actual command output depends on your system and environment. You need to run the commands and add their output manually.
