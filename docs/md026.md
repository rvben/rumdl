# MD026 - Keep headings clean and professional

## What this rule does

Removes trailing punctuation from the end of headings to maintain a clean, professional appearance. Question marks are allowed by default for FAQ-style headings.

## Why this matters

- **Professional appearance**: Clean headings look more polished and professional
- **Better readability**: Unnecessary punctuation can distract readers
- **Consistent style**: Maintains a uniform look throughout your document
- **Navigation clarity**: Clean headings work better in tables of contents and outlines
