# MD058 - Add blank lines around tables

Aliases: `blanks-around-tables`

## What this rule does

Ensures tables have blank lines before and after them for better readability and proper rendering.

## Why this matters

- **Clear visual separation**: Tables stand out better with surrounding space
- **Parser compatibility**: Some Markdown parsers require blank lines to recognize tables
- **Improved readability**: Easier to scan documents and find information
- **Consistent formatting**: Maintains uniform spacing throughout documents

## Examples

### ✅ Correct

```markdown
Here's our team structure:

| Name    | Department | Role      |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Alice   | Sales      | Manager   |
| Bob     | IT         | Developer |

As you can see, we have a diverse team.
```
