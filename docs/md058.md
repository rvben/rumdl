# MD058 - Add blank lines around tables

## What this rule does

Ensures tables have blank lines before and after them for better readability and proper rendering.

## Why this matters

- **Clear visual separation**: Tables stand out better with surrounding space
- **Parser compatibility**: Some Markdown parsers require blank lines to recognize tables
- **Improved readability**: Easier to scan documents and find information
- **Consistent formatting**: Maintains uniform spacing throughout documents

As you can see, we have a diverse team.
