# MD040 - Fenced Code Blocks Should Have a Language Specified

## Description

This rule ensures that fenced code blocks have a language specified. Adding a language to fenced code blocks  
enables syntax highlighting, making the code more readable and easier to understand.

<!-- rumdl-disable MD040 -->
## Examples

### Valid

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

### Invalid

```
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

### Fixed

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
<!-- rumdl-enable MD040 -->

## Configuration

This rule has the following configuration options:

- `allowed_languages`: An array of languages that are allowed. Default is an empty array, which allows any language.
- `language_only`: Whether to only check for the presence of a language, not its validity. Default is `false`.

## Special Cases

- This rule only applies to fenced code blocks (using backticks or tildes)
- It does not apply to indented code blocks
- The rule checks for the presence of a language specifier after the opening fence
- Common language specifiers include: `javascript`, `python`, `ruby`, `bash`, `markdown`, etc.
- Some Markdown processors support additional language aliases or custom language specifiers
