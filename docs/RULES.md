## Using Rules

Rules can be enabled, disabled, or configured in your rumdl configuration file:

```toml
# Global configuration options
[global]
# List of rules to disable
disable = ["MD013", "MD033"]

# Rule-specific configurations
[MD003]
style = "atx"  # Heading style (atx, atx_closed, setext)

[MD004]
style = "consistent"  # List style (asterisk, plus, dash, consistent)
```

For more information on configuring rumdl, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Rule Severities

Each rule has a default severity level:

- **error**: Rule violations will cause the linter to exit with a non-zero code
- **warning**: Rule violations will be reported but won't affect the exit code
- **info**: Rule violations are reported for informational purposes only

You can customize rule severities in your configuration file:

```toml
[MD013]
severity = "warning"  # Downgrade from error to warning
```

## Configuration

You can configure rumdl using a TOML configuration file. Create a default configuration file using:

```bash
rumdl init
```

This generates a `.rumdl.toml` file with default settings that you can customize.
