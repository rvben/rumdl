# MD022 - Add blank lines around headings

## What this rule does

Checks that headings have blank lines before and after them to improve readability and document structure.

## Why this matters

- **Better readability**: Blank lines create visual separation, making content easier to scan
- **Clear structure**: Spacing helps readers understand the document hierarchy
- **Consistent rendering**: Many Markdown processors require blank lines for proper formatting
- **Professional appearance**: Well-spaced documents look more polished and organized

And even more content.
```
