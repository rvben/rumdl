# MD044 - Use Proper Capitalization for Names

## What this rule does

Ensures brand names, product names, and technical terms are consistently capitalized throughout your documents.

## Why this matters

- **Professional appearance**: Incorrect capitalization looks careless and unprofessional
- **Brand respect**: Shows you care about getting company and product names right
- **Consistency**: Readers won't be confused by different variations of the same name
- **Searchability**: Consistent naming improves search results and indexing

## Examples

### ‚úÖ Correct

With configured names: `["JavaScript", "GitHub", "Node.js", "TypeScript"]`

```markdown
# JavaScript Development Guide

This guide covers JavaScript best practices for GitHub projects.

We'll be using Node.js and TypeScript for our examples.
```

### ‚ùå Incorrect  

```markdown
# Javascript Development Guide        <!-- Should be "JavaScript" -->

This guide covers javascript best practices for github projects.
<!-- "javascript" and "github" are incorrectly capitalized -->

We'll be using NodeJS and typescript for our examples.
<!-- "NodeJS" should be "Node.js", "typescript" should be "TypeScript" -->
```

    - "JavaScript"
    - "GitHub"  
    - "Node.js"
    - "npm"                  # Yes, npm is lowercase!
  code_blocks: false         # Check inside code blocks (default: true)
  html_elements: true        # Check inside HTML elements (default: true)
```
