# MD044 - Proper Names

## Description

This rule ensures that proper names are consistently capitalized throughout a document. This helps maintain  
consistency and professionalism in technical documentation.

The rule can be configured with a list of proper names and their correct capitalization.

<!-- rumdl-disable MD044 -->

## Examples

### Valid

With configuration `names: ["JavaScript", "Node.js", "GitHub"]`:

```markdown
# JavaScript Development Guide

This guide covers JavaScript and Node.js development practices for GitHub projects.
```

### Invalid

With the same configuration:

```markdown
# Javascript Development Guide

This guide covers javascript and nodejs development practices for github projects.
```

### Fixed

```markdown
# JavaScript Development Guide

This guide covers JavaScript and Node.js development practices for GitHub projects.
```

<!-- rumdl-enable MD044 -->

## Configuration

This rule has the following configuration options:

- `names`: An array of strings representing proper names with their correct capitalization. Default is an empty array.
- `code_blocks`: Whether to check code blocks for proper names. Default is `true`.
- `html_elements`: Whether to check HTML elements for proper names. Default is `true`.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "MD044": {
    "names": ["JavaScript", "Node.js", "GitHub"],
    "code_blocks": false,
    "html_elements": true
  }
}
```

## Special Cases

- This rule only applies when the `names` array is not empty
- The rule performs case-sensitive matching
- When `code_blocks` is `false`, proper names in code blocks are not checked
- When `html_elements` is `false`, proper names in HTML elements are not checked
- The rule does not check proper names in URLs or image paths
