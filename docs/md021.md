# MD021 - No Multiple Spaces in Closed ATX Heading

## Description

This rule ensures that there is only one space between the hash signs (#) and the heading text in closed ATX-style headings.
Multiple spaces can cause inconsistent rendering across different Markdown processors.

## Special Cases

- This rule only applies to closed ATX-style headings (those with hash signs at both the beginning and end)
- It does not apply to regular ATX headings (those with hash signs only at the beginning)
- It does not apply to setext-style headings (those underlined with = or -)
- Empty headings (just hash signs with no text) are not affected
- The rule checks for multiple spaces both before and after the heading text
