# MD064 - No Multiple Consecutive Spaces

Aliases: `no-multiple-consecutive-spaces`

## Rule Details

This rule is triggered when multiple consecutive spaces (2 or more) are found
in markdown content. Multiple spaces between words serve no purpose in markdown
and typically indicate formatting issues or copy-paste artifacts.

## Rationale

Multiple consecutive spaces in markdown:

1. **Render as single space**: Most markdown renderers collapse multiple spaces
   into a single space, so extra spaces have no visual effect
2. **Indicate potential issues**: Often result from copy-paste errors or
   accidental keystrokes
3. **Reduce readability**: Make the source markdown harder to read

## Examples

### Incorrect

```markdown
This is   a sentence with extra spaces.

- List   item with extra spaces

> Quote   with extra spaces
```

### Correct

```markdown
This is a sentence with single spaces.

- List item with single spaces

> Quote with single spaces
```

## Exceptions

This rule does NOT flag spaces in the following contexts:

### 1. Inline Code Spans

Spaces inside inline code are intentional and preserved:

```markdown
Use `code   with   spaces` for formatting.
```

### 2. Fenced/Indented Code Blocks

Code block content is not processed:

````markdown
```
code   with   intentional   spaces
```
````

### 3. Leading Indentation

Leading whitespace for structure is preserved:

```markdown
    Indented paragraph (4 spaces)
```

### 4. Trailing Spaces

All trailing spaces are handled by MD009 and are not flagged by this rule:

```markdown
Line with trailing spaces
Another line with trailing spaces
```

Use MD009 to control trailing space behavior.

### 5. Front Matter

YAML/TOML/JSON front matter is not processed:

```markdown
---
title:   Document Title
author:   John Doe
---
```

### 6. HTML Comments

Content inside HTML comments is not processed:

```markdown
<!-- comment   with   spaces -->
```

### 7. HTML Blocks

Content inside HTML block elements is not processed.

### 8. Table Rows

Table rows with alignment padding are not flagged:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
```

GFM-style tables without leading/trailing pipes are also skipped:

```markdown
Header 1  | Header 2  | Header 3
--------- | --------- | ---------
Cell 1    | Cell 2    | Cell 3
```

The spaces used for visual alignment in tables are intentional.

### 9. List Marker Spacing

Spaces after list markers are handled by MD030, not MD064:

```markdown
*   Item with extra space after marker
1.  Numbered item with extra space
```

### 10. Blockquote Marker Spacing

Spaces after blockquote markers are handled by MD027:

```markdown
>  Quote with extra space after marker
>>  Nested blockquote
```

### 11. Reference Link Definitions

Spaces after the colon in reference link definitions:

```markdown
[ref]:  https://example.com
[link]:   https://example.com "Title"
```

### 12. Footnote Markers

Spaces after footnote markers:

```markdown
[^1]:  Footnote text
[^note]:   Extended footnote
```

### 13. Definition List Markers

Spaces after definition list markers (PHP Markdown Extra / Pandoc):

```markdown
Term
:   Definition text
```

### 14. Task List Checkboxes

Spaces after task list checkboxes:

```markdown
- [ ]  Unchecked task
- [x]  Checked task
```

## Fix

The automatic fix collapses multiple consecutive spaces into a single space.

Before:

```markdown
This is   a sentence   with extra   spaces.
```

After:

```markdown
This is a sentence with extra spaces.
```

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options. It is enabled by default.
