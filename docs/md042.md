# MD042 - No Empty Links

## Description

This rule ensures that Markdown links have both a link text and a URL. Empty links can confuse readers  
and cause issues with navigation and accessibility.

Empty links can occur when either the link text or the URL is missing.

<!-- rumdl-disable MD042 -->
## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)

[Reference link][reference]

[reference]: https://example.com
```

### Invalid

```markdown
[](https://example.com)

[Empty URL]()

[ ](https://example.com)

[Visit our website]()
```

### Fixed

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)

[Link text](https://example.com)

[Link text](https://example.com)

[Visit our website](https://example.com)
```
<!-- rumdl-enable MD042 -->
