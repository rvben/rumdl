# MD042 - Avoid Empty Links

## What this rule does

Detects links that are missing either their text or URL, ensuring all links are complete and functional.

## Why this matters

- **User frustration**: Clicking empty links leads nowhere and confuses readers
- **Accessibility issues**: Screen readers can't describe links without text
- **Professional quality**: Empty links look like mistakes or unfinished work
- **SEO impact**: Search engines penalize broken or empty links
