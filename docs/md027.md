# MD027 - No multiple spaces after quote marker

## What this rule does

Ensures quoted text has only one space after the > symbol, not multiple spaces.

## Why this matters

- **Consistency**: Extra spaces create uneven indentation in quotes
- **Readability**: Consistent spacing makes quoted content easier to follow
- **Standards**: One space after > is the Markdown convention

## Examples

### ‚úÖ Correct

```markdown
> This is a properly formatted quote.
> Each line has one space after the > symbol.
> 
> Even with paragraph breaks.

> > Nested quotes also follow this rule.
> > Each level has one space.
```

### ‚ùå Incorrect

<!-- rumdl-disable MD027 -->

```markdown
>  This quote has two spaces after >
>   This line has three spaces
>    This line has four spaces

> >  Nested quote with extra spaces
```

<!-- rumdl-enable MD027 -->

### üîß Fixed

```markdown
> This quote has two spaces after >
> This line has three spaces
> This line has four spaces

> > Nested quote with extra spaces
```
