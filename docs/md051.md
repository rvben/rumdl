# MD051 - Link anchors should exist

## What this rule does

Ensures that links to sections within the same document (like `#introduction`) point to actual headings that exist. Cross-file fragment links (like `file.md#heading`) are not validated by this rule.

## Why this matters

- **Navigation**: Broken internal links frustrate readers trying to jump to sections
- **Maintenance**: Helps you catch links that break when headings are renamed
- **User experience**: Ensures smooth document navigation

## Examples

### ‚úÖ Correct

```markdown
# Introduction

## Getting Started

See the [Introduction](#introduction) for background.

Jump to [Getting Started](#getting-started) to begin.

# Working with **bold** and *italic*

Link to [formatted heading](#working-with-bold-and-italic)

<!-- Cross-file links are ignored by MD051 -->
See [external documentation](README.md#setup) for setup instructions.
```

### ‚ùå Incorrect

<!-- rumdl-disable MD051 -->

```markdown
# Introduction

## Getting Started

[Jump to Installation](#installation)  <!-- No "Installation" heading exists -->

[See Overview](#overview)  <!-- No "Overview" heading exists -->
```

<!-- rumdl-enable MD051 -->

### üîß Fixed

This rule cannot automatically fix missing anchors - you need to either:
- Add the missing heading
- Update the link to point to an existing heading
- Remove the broken link

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options.

## Automatic fixes

This rule does not provide automatic fixes since it cannot guess which heading you meant to link to.

## How heading anchors work

When you create a heading like `## Getting Started`, Markdown automatically creates an anchor `#getting-started` that you can link to. The conversion follows these rules:

1. Convert to lowercase: `Getting Started` ‚Üí `getting started`
2. Replace spaces with hyphens: `getting started` ‚Üí `getting-started`
3. Remove special characters: `FAQ's & Tips!` ‚Üí `faqs-tips`
4. Strip formatting: `**Bold** Text` ‚Üí `bold-text`
