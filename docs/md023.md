# MD023 - Headings Must Start at the Beginning of the Line

## Description

This rule ensures that all headings start at the beginning of the line, without any indentation.
Indented headings can cause inconsistent rendering across different Markdown processors.

<!-- rumdl-disable MD023 -->

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Invalid

```markdown
   # Heading 1
  ## Heading 2
 ### Heading 3
```

### Fixed

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

<!-- rumdl-enable MD023 -->

## Special Cases

- This rule applies to both ATX-style headings (with hash signs) and setext-style headings (underlined with = or -)
- It does not apply to headings in code blocks
- The rule checks for any whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of the line
- Indentation within the heading text after the hash signs is not affected by this rule
